# Set
        
        The Dart Set is the unordered collection of the different values of the same type. It has much functionality, which is the same as an array, but it is unordered. Set doesn't allow storing the duplicate values. The set must contain unique values.

* Syntax 
       

        var setName = <type>{};  
                  Or   
        Set<type> setname = {};
