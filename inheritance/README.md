# Dart Inheritance

        Dart inheritance is defined as the process of deriving the properties and characteristics of another class. It provides the ability to create a new class from an existing class. It is the most essential concept of the oops(Object-Oriented programming approach). We can reuse the all the behavior and characteristics of the previous class in the new class.

# Types of Inheritance

*  Single Inheritance
*  Multilevel Inheritance
*  Hierarchical Inheritance

* NOTE
        Dart doesn't support multiple inheritance.


*  Single inheritance
        
        In the single inheritance, a class is inherited by a single class or subclass is inherited by one parent class. 

*  Multilevel Inheritance
        In the multiple inheritance, a subclass is inherited by another subclass or creates the chaining of inheritance.        

*  Hierarchical Inheritance
        In the hierarchical inherence, two or more classes inherit a single class.
