 # Break Statement:
        This statement is used to break the flow of control of the loop i.e if it is used within a loop then it will terminate the loop whenever encountered. It will bring the flow of control out of the nearest loop.

* Syntax

        break;     



# Continue Statement:
        While the break is used to end the flow of control, continue on the other hand is used to continue the flow of control. When a continue statement is encountered in a loop it doesnâ€™t terminate the loop but rather jump the flow to next iteration.

* Syntax:

        continue;
