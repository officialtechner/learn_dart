# for Loop
   The for loop is used when we know how many times a block of code will execute. 

* for… in Loop
   The for…in loop is slightly different from the for loop. It only takes dart object or expression as an iterator and iterates the element one at a time. The value of the element is bound to var, which is and valid and available for the loop body. The loop will execute until no element left in the iterator.   

* for each Loop
   The for-each loop iterates over all elements in some container/collectible and passes the elements to some specific function.
