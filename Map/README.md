#  Dart Map

        Dart Map is an object that stores data in the form of a key-value pair. Each value is associated with its key, and it is used to access its corresponding value. Both keys and values can be any type. In Dart Map, each key must be unique, but the same value can occur multiple times. The Map representation is quite similar to Python Dictionary. The Map can be declared by using curly braces {} ,and each key-value pair is separated by the commas(,). The value of the key can be accessed by using a square bracket([]).

*  Syntax: 

        var map_name = {key1:value1, key2:value2 [.......,key_n: value_n]}
