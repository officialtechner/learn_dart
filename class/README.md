# Class 
        Dart classes are the blueprint of the object, or it can be called object constructors. A class can contain fields, functions, constructors, etc. It is a wrapper that binds/encapsulates the data and functions together; that can be accessed by creating an object. A class can refer to as user-define data type which defines characteristics by its all objects.

# Using constructors
        A constructor is a different type of function which is created with same name as its class name. The constructor is used to initialize an object when it is created. When we create the object of class, then constructor is automatically called. It is quite similar to class function but it has no explicit return type. The generative constructor is the most general form of the constructor, which is used to create a new instance of a class.

# Types of Constructors
* Default Constructors
* Parameter Constructor
* Named Constructors.

* Default Constructors
        A Constructor which has no parameter is called default constructor or no-arg constructor. It is automatically created (with no argument) by Dart compiler if we don't declare in the class. 

* Parameter Constructor
        We can also pass the parameters to a constructor that type of constructor is called parameterized constructor. It is used to initialize instance variables. 


* Named Constructors
        The named constructors are used to declare the multiple constructors in single class.
